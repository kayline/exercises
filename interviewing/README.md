## Exercises

### Implement a Trie

Implement a `Trie` class.

See: <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie>

### Validate Binary Search Tree

Given a binary tree, implement `isValidBST(tree)` which returns `true` if the `tree` is a valid binary search tree and `false` otherwise.

### All Words on Boggle Board

Given an `n`-by-`n` Boggle board, return all of the valid words on the board.

### Remove Kth Node From End of List

Given a linked list and a position `k`, return a new linked list which is equal to the original list but with the `k`-th element from the end removed. Just to clarify how indexing-from-the-end works, here, if `k=1` then you should remove the last element of the list.

### Breakable String

Given a string and a list of words, write a function `isBreakable(string, words)` if spaces can be inserted into `string` so that it consists only of words in the `words` array.

### Alien Dictionary

You are given a list of lexicographically sorted words from an alien language. This language, despite sharing a character set with ASCII, has a unique order. Return the alphabetical order of all the letters found in the list of words. There may be more than one possible answer.
