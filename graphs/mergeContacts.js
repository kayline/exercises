/**
 * Given a contact list where each entry is a person's name and a list of email addresses, merge
 * contacts that share any email address. Each contact can be represented as an object with a name
 * and an array of email addresses. If two contacts share an email, they are considered the same person
 * and should be merged into a single contact entry.
 *
 * The function should return a new list of merged contacts. Each merged contact should have a unique set
 * of email addresses and may include names from any of the original unmerged entries.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: [
 *   { name: "Alice", emails: ["alice@example.com", "alice@gmail.com"] },
 *   { name: "Bob", emails: ["bob@example.com"] },
 *   { name: "Alice Smith", emails: ["alice@gmail.com"] }
 * ]
 * Output: [
 *   { name: "Alice Smith", emails: ["alice@example.com", "alice@gmail.com"] },
 *   { name: "Bob", emails: ["bob@example.com"] }
 * ]
