/**
 * Given an array of strings, write a function to check if the strings can be chained
 * to form a circle. A string X can be chained together with another string Y if the
 * last character of X is the same as the first character of Y.
 *
 * For example, ["bear", "radish"] can be chained because the last letter of "bear" is
 * 'r' and the first letter of "radish" is also 'r'. This function should return true
 * if all the strings in the array can be chained in such a way that they form a circle.
