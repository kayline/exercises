/**
 * Given a 2D binary matrix, find the number of islands. An island is surrounded by water
 * and is formed by connecting adjacent lands horizontally or vertically. You may assume
 * all four edges of the matrix are surrounded by water.
 *
 * For example, the matrix below contains 4 islands:
 * [
 *   [1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
 *   [0, 1, 0, 0, 1],
 *   [0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
 *   [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
 *   [1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
 * ]
