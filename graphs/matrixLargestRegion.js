/**
 * Given a 2D binary matrix where each cell contains either a '0' or a '1', with '1' representing
 * a filled cell, find the size of the largest region formed by connected filled cells.
 * Cells are considered connected if they are adjacent horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
 *
 * For example, the matrix below:
 * [
 *   [1, 1, 0, 0],
 *   [0, 1, 1, 0],
 *   [0, 0, 1, 0],
 *   [1, 0, 0, 0]
 * ]
 * The largest region has 5 filled cells.
