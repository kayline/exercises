/**
 * Given a graph G, represented as an adjacency list, return its line graph Line(G).
 *
 * See: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_graph
 *
 * To form the line graph, we turn edges in to vertexes and vice versa. Every edge
 * in G becomes a vertex in Line(G).
 *
 * If e1 and e2 are edges in G then there's an edge (e1, e2) in Line(G) if e1 and e2
 * share a vertex in the original graph.
