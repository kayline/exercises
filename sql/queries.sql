-- Below are a bunch of "plain English" sentences.  Your job is to take a stab
-- at translating each one into a single SELECT query.  You can write your
-- query below each "plain English" sentence.

-- Some things to keep in mind about the `imdb` schema:
--
-- 1. The `title` table contains information about ALL entities on IMDb:
--    movies, TV shows, miniseries, etc. You have to join other tables if you
--    only want to look at one type of media.
--
-- 2. The IMDb database contains lots of no-name movies. It can help to
--    preemptively filtering the set of movies you're querying by the number of
--    votes, e.g., only look at movies with at least 200 votes.

-- QUERIES --

-- The highest-rated and lowest-rated movies per year, with ties
-- broken by highest number of votes.


-- TODO: Add lowest-rated movie per year
-- Other issues w/ this query
-- The vote cutoff is arbitrary
-- Ideas:
--   Somehow include range of cutoffs to see effect of cutoff
--   Determine cutoff dynamically somehow, e.g., movies with more-than-median number of votes for that year
