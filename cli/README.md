## `Brewfile`

Check out the `Brewfile` in this directory to see all of the things I've installed with homebrew.

## Keep In Mind

- There are two "strands" of UNIX tools: GNU and BSD. For example, there's GNU `find` and BSD `find`. GNU tools are the default on Linux and BSD tools are the default most everywhere else. They share a core set of features, command line arguments, functionality, etc. but often have key differences.

  If you find a resource online, especially one recommending one-liners, keep in mind which one they're describing.
- Shells like `zsh` and `bash` also share a core feature set and syntax, but can sigerge significantly. Only using features supported by `bash` is generally the more conservative choice.
- Not all commands are standalone executables. Commands like `cd` and `type` are built into the shell.

## Don't Forget These Commands

This is a list of commands that one uses frequently when writing shell scripts and one-liners. Use `man` to learn more about them (or `-h`/`--help` if they support it). Use `which` to determine where the command lives, or if it's built-in.

- `find` / `xargs` / `echo`
- `grep` / `sed` / `awk` / `tr` / `cut`
- `sort` / `uniq` / `wc` / `column`
- `date` / `time`
- `du` / `df`
- `which` / `type` / `file` / `realpath`
- `ifconfig` / `ipconfig`
- `ls` / `ps` / `lsof` / `netstat`
- `curl` / `jq`
- `ping` / `traceroute`
- `tcpdump`  / `arp` / `dig`

## Projects + Exercises

1. Use `brew info --json` to get descriptions of all the programs in the `Brewfile`. See if there are any that interest you!
1. `/usr/sbin` and `/usr/bin` are filled with all sorts of interesting programs. Using `man -S1:8 -k`("apropos mode") try to figure out what they all are. You'll probably want to redirect `stderr` to `/dev/null` using `2> /dev/null`.
1. There's a command that lives at `/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/Apple80211.framework/Versions/Current/Resources/airport` which displays all your WiFi information with the `-I` option. Subtract `agrCtlNoise` from `agrCtlRSSI` to get your signal strength.

   You can use `sed` to produce an expression like `-44 - -89` and then use `bc` to evaluate the expression.
1. Write a script that analyzes your command line history and prints out the most commonly used commands. For the first version, have it only be the left-most command then modify it so it recognizes other commands in a pipeline.
1. Using the `gh` command, write a one-liner that clones all of a GitHub user's repositories in parallel. Both `xargs` and the `paralell` command can execute things in parallel.
1. Find a Node project and look at the `package-lock.json`, which contains all of the project's dependencies. Write a one-liner that parses it and prints out links to all the GitHub project URLs.
1. Use `curl` to pull down the text of Moby Dick from Project Gutenberg (<https://www.gutenberg.org/files/2701/2701-0.txt>). Write a one-liner that prints out the 100 most common words. Modify the one-liner to strip out [stop words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_word) like "the", "an", "of", etc.
